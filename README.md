# Speech_Recognition

🎙️ Speech Recognition with Python — Mini Project

This project explores the fundamentals of building a basic Speech Recognition system using Python. It provides a hands-on introduction to audio input processing and converting speech to text. The project is ideal for beginners and intermediate learners interested in natural language processing (NLP), voice-based interfaces, or building voice-enabled applications.

Throughout the course of this mini project, several key concepts and components were explored and implemented:

🚀 1. Setting Up the Environment
We began by configuring the development environment with the necessary libraries. This includes installing Python packages .

🎤 2. Capturing Audio Input
We implemented functionality to capture audio from the user's microphone. This involves:

Accessing the default input device

Recording short or long phrases

Saving audio temporarily for processing
This is the first step in transforming real-world speech into digital text.

⚙️ 3. Processing the Audio
Once audio is captured, it undergoes processing to make it suitable for recognition. 

🧠 4. Speech Recognition
Using Python's speech_recognition

📦 Requirements
Python 3.x

speechrecognition
